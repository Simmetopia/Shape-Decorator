# Decorator Pattern in .NET core 2.

## Shape Implementation.

This is made with a shape interface, which has implemented classes Circle and
Rectangle. These classes are then the "concrete implementation of the IShape
Interface.

Lets say we now want to make it so our Shapes also has a color. What we want, is
a way to achieve this without making changes to the Interface or concrete
implementations.
